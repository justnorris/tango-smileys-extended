Tango Smileys Extended (TSE) is designed to replace the standard WordPress smileys and extend the number of available smileys from 18 to 202.

== Description ==
Tango Smileys Extended (TSE) disables the built-in WordPress smileys and extends the number of available smileys from 18 to 202. The extended smileys can be input using standard emoticon shorthand, or through the CTI (Click to Insert) interface. Smileys in comments is supported and may be inserted using the standard emoticon shorthand or through the CTI interface. MCEComments is also supported.     
     
This version of Tango Smileys Extended is for **WordPress 2.8+**     
WordPress versions pre-2.8 are ***no longer supported***. If you are using WordPress 2.7.x, please use Tango Smileys Extended 2.5.4.1. WordPress 2.6.x and earlier are only supported in versions of Tango Smileys Extended older than, and including, 2.5.2.8.


== Installation ==
Installation of TSE is easy. Simply follow these directions:

1. Upload `tango-smileys-extended` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. If this is your first installation of TSE, you may enable TSE on the TSE admin page at `Settings » Tango Smileys Extended`. If you are upgrading, TSE retains its settings from the previous installation. You may change the options on the TSE admin page at `Settings » Tango Smileys Extended`
4. The comment CTI interface is not supported by some themes, but standard emoticon shorthand will still work. See the FAQs for information on adding support for CTI to your theme. Comment CTI may be disabled on the TSE Options page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do you input each smiley? =
1. **CLICK TO INSERT:** Click the PIGGY icon in TinyMCE while in Visual editing mode to add a smiley to your post. If CTI is enabled for comments, you simply click the smiley you want and the shorthand will be inserted into the comment box.
2. **MANUALLY:** For a complete and up-to-date list of all available smileys and the shorthand to input each one, please check the plugin homepage [here](http://munashiku.slightofmind.net/wordpress-plugins/tango-smileys-extended).

= How do I add support to my theme for CTI for comments? =
1. Open the `comments.php` file for your theme and look for the text `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>`.
2. If the text is missing, locate your comment textarea which should be something like `<textarea name="comment" id="comment"></textarea>` and add `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` either above or below the textarea. Wherever you add this line, the CTI scrollbox will appear.
3. SEE THE NEXT QUESTION FOR MORE OPTIONS!

= How do I add the CTI interface to a textarea, including the one for comments? =
1. You can use the function `tse_cti_anywhere( 'target', OUTPUT )` where ***'target'*** is the ID of the textarea you are using and ***OUTPUT*** is boolean **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
2. Set ***OUTPUT*** to **TRUE** to echo the CTI smileys to the page, and **FALSE** to use the output of the function in a variable.
3. ***'target'*** defaults to **'comment'** if not set.
4. ***OUTPUT*** defaults to **TRUE** if not set.
6. **TO STYLE**: You can add CSS to your theme's stylesheet. SEE EXAMPLE #4 BELOW.
5. SEE THE PREVIOUS QUESTION FOR ANOTHER OPTION FOR THE COMMENT TEXTAREA.

= EXAMPLES =
1. Use `<?php tse_cti_anywhere(); ?>` to manually add the CTI smileys to your comment form. This will automatically print the clickable smileys to the comment form in whichever location you use. If you add this before the textarea, you get smileys before the textarea. If you add this after the textarea, you get smileys after the textarea. If you use this manual function, please uncheck ***Enable CTI for comments*** on the TSE Options page.
2. Use `<?php tse_cti_anywhere( 'bananas' ); ?>` to print clickable smileys for use on the textarea defined as `<textarea id="bananas"></textarea>`.
3. Use `$variable = tse_cti_anywhere( 'oranges', false );` to use `$variable` elsewhere in PHP. `$variable` reverences `<textarea id="oranges"></textarea>` and can be used as `<?php echo $variable; ?>` on the form containing the textarea.
4. You can style the box containing the CTI smileys in your theme's stylesheet. For `tse_cti_anywhere( 'grapes', true )` you can reference the box as `#tseCTIsmileys-grapes` and for `tse_cti_anywhere( 'apples', true )` you can reference the box as `#tseCTIsmileys-apples`.


== Change Log ==
= [2011-07-25] v2.7.0.0 =
ADDITION: Updated the CTI interface when using MCEComments. There is now a button in the MCEComments toolbar!     
ADDITION: Further optimized the plugin for faster operation.     
BUGFIX: Reinserted the filter priority which was removed in previous versions for no reason. TSE should now wait until all other filters have been applied before changing shortcode to images.     
BUGFIX: Changed the way custom smiley sizes were handled which should improve the display quality of smileys between 18px and 20px.

= [2011-06-29] v2.6.5.0 =
BUGFIX: Updated regex pattern to skip HTML excaped characters which were triggering the wink smiley when followed by a right parenthesis.     
ADDITION: Changed the smiley size selection options to allow for any smiley size from 16px to 24px to better fit any theme.     
ADDITION: Changed the comment smiley box width selection to allow percentages. The smiley box will stop breaking out of nested comment replies if the width is specified as a percentage.

BUGFIX: MCEComments is working again.

= [2010-03-29] v2.6.4.0 =
ADDITION: Groups of smileys can be disabled for comments, while all smileys are still available for post and page editing. This does NOT disable converting smiley shorthand into images, so any previously entered smileys in comments will still appear as images.     
NOTICE: It appears that MCEComments has been updated since support for it was added to TSE, and this update has broken compatibility with MCEComments. A fix is in the works, but it may be a while before it is available. Until then, users of MCEComments will have to choose between using MCEComments or Tango Smileys Extended.

= [2009-12-05] v2.6.2.0 =

BUGFIX: Fixed images for `:hugleft:` and `:hugright:`     
ADDITION: Added ability to use CTI interface on any textarea.     
NOTE: Adding the CTI interface on a textarea does not mean the shorthand will be converted to smileys. I will offer support for those who wish to do this, but I offer no guarantees.

= [2008-12-27] v2.5.0.2 =
BUGFIX: The javascript to prevent conflicting options on the TSE Options page was not working.     
BUGFIX: WordPress installed to its own directory not working. Replaced instances of `get_bloginfo('url')` with `get_bloginfo('wpurl')` to fix.

= [2008-11-03] v2.2.0 =
BUGFIX: Removed double slashes from smileys in comments CTI box.     
ADDITION: Added basic CSS styling options for displaying the comments CTI box. This should allow most people to style the comments CTI box to fit their theme and prevent it from breaking the theme layout.

= [2008-10-27] v2.1.0 =
BUGFIX: Most bugs worked out of CTI interface. There are probably some bugs left, but they will be addressed when they are located.

= [2008-10-14] v1.7.1 =
BUGFIX: Reorganized smiley list to fix the smiley within a smiley issue. `:-)` is a part of `:-))` so typing `:-))` resulted in a smile followed by `)` - which was incorrect. You can now safely use `:-))` and the output is a big smile - as it should be.     
ADDITION: Added `:/` as a valid smiley without breaking links.

= [2008-10-13] v1.7.0.6 =

= [2008-10-13] v1.7.0.2 =
BUGFIX: Added a priority of 500 to the filter so TSE would wait until most other plugins finish manipulating the post before replacing the shorthand with images. This should help keep IMG tags from getting split by most other filters.     
ADDITION: Added `:-/` as a valid smiley, as some people were trying to use it.     

= [2008-10-12] v1.7 =
BUGFIX: Fixed problem from v1.1 regarding two character smileys - which were removed in the meantime in v1.5. Standard two characters smileys have been re-included.

BUGFIX: Some smiley shorthand only contained two chars and caused issues. Issues also caused by certain shorthand using `!` and `?`. Removed all two char shorthand and fixed issue with other shorthand.     
ADDITION: Added an admin page to enable/disable TSE at `Settings » Tango Smileys Extended`     
ADDITION: Added ability to toggle TSE for posts and comments on TSE admin page.

BUGFIX: `str_ireplace()` not a valid function in PHP4. Function replaced with `preg_replace()`.     
Now fully PHP4 / PHP5 compatible.
